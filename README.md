This repository contains a Perl script demonstrating an uncommon bug related to hash iteration order.  Perl's hash iteration order is not defined, meaning the order in which keys are processed can vary between runs and even within a single run.  This can lead to subtle and difficult-to-debug errors, especially when the output depends on the iteration order. The bug.pl file shows the issue. The bugSolution.pl provides a solution by explicitly sorting the keys before iteration.
